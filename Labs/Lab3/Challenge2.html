       <p class="greenText">It was pretty apparent that the 35-year-old’s days with the circuit were nearing their end — at the Singapore Grand Prix last weekend, he was called into the pits by his RB team ahead of the final lap, giving the Australian an opportunity to set the fastest lap of the race.</p>
       <p class="greenText">At the race’s conclusion, he sat in his car for an unusual amount of time before walking through a gauntlet of supporters who lined up to applaud him. His post-race interviews were emotional, acknowledging he may have concluded his final race.</p>
