    <h1>Premier League News</h1>
    <h2>Wolves vs Liverpool</h2>
    <p> <strong> Rayan Aït-Nouri </strong> cancelled out <strong>Ibrahima Konaté’s</strong> opener, only for <em>Liverpool</em> to win a penalty in the immediate aftermath of the equaliser.
       From the spot, <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong> hit his fifth goal of the season to earn the points, even though his side failed to reach the levels Arne Slot expects.</p>

      <p><em>Wolves</em> started promisingly, maintaining possession without creating a dangerous opening as <strong>Alisson</strong> enjoyed a bedding-in period after returning from a hamstring injury. In central midfield, the trio of <strong>João Gomes, Mario Lemina and André</strong> are hard working but unlikely to find an opening with a clever pass. They were, however, able to keep <em>Liverpool’s</em> triumvirate quiet, forcing them to go wide when attacking. Despite the odd scare, <em>Wolves</em> were coping with what <strong>Luis Díaz</strong> and <strong>Salah</strong> were throwing at them as the visitors attempted to quickly turn defence into attack without success. Liverpool produced a sluggish start by their standards, struggling to find a rhythm and lacking the speed to break through the Wolves defence.</p>
